# unconference.events — production runbook

One compose project on Hetzner `frontrange-twin-1` (`2.29.37.247`, CX33, Helsinki), beside the
Bioregional Twin. It shares nothing with the Twin except the machine: its own network, volumes,
Caddy and firewall (`unconference-fw`: 80/tcp, 443/tcp, 443/udp, attached alongside the Twin's
SSH-only firewall).

| Service | Image | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `caddy` | `caddy:2-alpine` | TLS and routing (`Caddyfile`); the only service publishing ports |
| `app` | `unconference-app` (this repo, `Dockerfile`) | Next.js AppView + web |
| `migrate` | same image | one-shot `db/migrations` runner, before `app` |
| `indexer` | same image | Jetstream consumer |
| `scheduler` | `curlimages/curl` | job loop: close rounds (1 min), dispatch notifications (5 min), reconcile ATProto (hourly), retention (daily) |
| `postgres` | `postgres:16-alpine` | the AppView database |
| `pds` | `ghcr.io/bluesky-social/pds:0.4` | our PDS: custodial and gathering accounts |
| `backup` | `backup.Dockerfile` | nightly encrypted Postgres + PDS backup to R2 |

## Names

| Name | Served by |
|---|---|
| `unconference.events` | app |
| `www.unconference.events` | redirect to the apex |
| `pds.unconference.events` | PDS (whole) |
| `<handle>.unconference.events` | `/.well-known/atproto-did` and `/xrpc/*` → PDS; anything else → app |
| `<gathering-slug>.unconference.events` | the gathering's pages (app), and the gathering account's handle |

DNS (Namecheap): `A @`, `A www`, `A pds`, `A *` → `2.29.37.247`. Resend: DKIM TXT
`resend._domainkey`, SPF TXT `send`, MX `send` → `feedback-smtp.us-east-1.amazonses.com` (needs
Namecheap Mail Settings = Custom MX), CNAME `rsend`.

**`PDS_HOSTNAME` and `PDS_HANDLE_DOMAIN` are written into every DID document the PDS mints.** Never
change them casually; moving hosts is a PLC operation per account (see Free School's
`docs/runbooks/pds-hostname-migration.md`).

## Secrets

`deploy/unconference/.env` on the server (mode 600), generated from `.env.example`. A copy lives in
`~/.config/unconference/production.env` on the operator's Mac. The age private key for backups lives
only there (`~/.config/unconference/backup-age.key`), never on the server. The PLC rotation key is the
one secret that cannot be regenerated.

## First deploy

```sh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/frontrange-twin root@2.29.37.247
git clone -b atproto https://github.com/omniharmonic/schellingpoint.git /opt/unconference
cd /opt/unconference
install -m 600 /dev/null deploy/unconference/.env   # then paste the prepared env
deploy/unconference/release.sh
```

`release.sh` pulls, backs up (when a stack is running), builds, starts Postgres and the PDS, runs
migrations, starts everything, waits for `/api/health`, and runs the privacy audit.

## Everyday operations

```sh
cd /opt/unconference
C="docker compose --env-file deploy/unconference/.env -f deploy/unconference/compose.yml -p unconference"
$C ps
$C logs -f --tail=100 app indexer scheduler
$C exec app npm run -s atproto:audit            # privacy audit against production
$C run --rm --no-deps --entrypoint /usr/local/bin/backup.sh backup   # backup now
```

Roll back: `git checkout <previous commit> && deploy/unconference/release.sh` (the previous image is
also tagged `unconference-app:rollback-<commit>`).

## Restore rehearsal

```sh
# On the operator's Mac: fetch a night from R2, then decrypt with the off-box key
age -d -i ~/.config/unconference/backup-age.key postgres.sql.gz.age | gunzip > restore.sql
age -d -i ~/.config/unconference/backup-age.key pds-sqlite.tar.gz.age | tar -xz -C restore-pds/
age -d -i ~/.config/unconference/backup-age.key pds-blocks.tar.gz.age | tar -xz -C restore-pds/
# Postgres: create a scratch database and psql -f restore.sql; compare row counts.
# PDS: stop pds, replace the volume contents with restore-pds/, start pds, check /xrpc/_health and a getRepo.
```

## Health and verification

- `https://unconference.events/api/health` → `{"status":"ok","checks":{"db":"ok","pds":"ok"}}`
- `https://unconference.events/oauth/client-metadata.json` → confidential client (`private_key_jwt`)
- `https://pds.unconference.events/xrpc/_health` → PDS version
- `https://<handle>.unconference.events/.well-known/atproto-did` → that account's DID
- Relay: `https://bsky.network/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getRepoStatus?did=<did>` once the PDS has requested a crawl
