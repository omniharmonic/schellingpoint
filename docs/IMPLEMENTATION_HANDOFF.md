## Current State Summary

### September 2026 frontend polish

The second design pass adds a scroll-driven, interactive propose/vote/gather walkthrough, event posters, stronger dashboard summaries, and larger calendar controls with track-colored session cards.

A shared daylight visual system now covers the public site, event workspaces, organizer tools, creation wizard, onboarding, and utility pages. See [UX direction](design/UX_POLISH.md) and [verification notes](design/UX_POLISH_QA.md).

Notable behavior fixes: event-aware sign-in return paths and magic-link initialization; per-event voting-credit cache refresh; rollback and visible feedback for failed vote/bookmark/organizer saves; calendar date boundaries and event-timezone display; accessible theme shades and light/dark mode; completed-event participation controls; working filter reset; recoverable empty/error states.

Production build and six focused logic checks pass. Browser verification covers public and attendee flows, including fresh local email sign-in and saving a session. Full organizer workflow verification remains pending approval to accept the disposable local test event’s terms. No production data was changed or deployment performed.

## Notes

- The master implementation plan is at `docs/MULTI_TENANT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Each task has an ID like P4.1.2 (Phase 4, Task 1, Subtask 2)
- Private event invitations are NOT explicitly in the plan - may need to be added if visibility:private is used
- Current co-host invite system at `/invite/[token]` is for session co-hosts, not event membership

### September 14 reliability follow-up

See `docs/design/UX_POLISH_QA.md` for reproduced errors, fixes, validation, and remaining checks. New local migrations provide atomic event creation and database-enforced participation rules; deploy these before the corresponding app code. Event settings now supports publishing and lifecycle transitions. Build, typecheck, 20 targeted tests, and rolled-back SQL participation checks pass. Full organizer browser verification awaits the prepared local event's terms/submission approval; production readiness is not yet signed off.


### 2026-09-14 release hardening

Production candidate includes Next.js 15.5.25 / React 19.3.0, zero npm audit findings, verified server access-token cookies, private/draft read isolation, JWT-scoped session creation, and corrected calendar exports. New migrations: `20260914000001` atomic creation, `20260914000002` participation guards, and `20260914000003` event read access. See `docs/design/UX_POLISH_QA.md` for validation and its limits.
