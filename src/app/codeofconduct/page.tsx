          under Settings once you are a member. A gathering&apos;s own document adds to this one; it never

            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-5 mb-2">Respect</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-muted-foreground space-y-2">
              <li>Treat every participant, speaker, volunteer, and organizer with dignity and respect.</li>
              <li>Respect the physical and digital privacy of others.</li>
              <li>If you want to take a photo or record, get consent first. A red lanyard signifies someone who has asked not to be photographed.</li>
              <li>Follow the Chatham House Rule when indicated: you may share information from a session, but do not attribute it to a specific speaker.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-5 mb-2">Collaboration</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-muted-foreground space-y-2">
              <li>Be open to new ideas and learning from others — we are stronger when we share.</li>
              <li>In moments of disagreement, stay focused on the substance of the discussion. Agree to disagree when necessary and move toward shared goals.</li>
              <li>Talk to people you don&apos;t know. They are friends you haven&apos;t met yet.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-5 mb-2">Inclusion</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-muted-foreground space-y-2">
              <li>Mingle. We all carry perspectives that can help each other in unexpected ways.</li>
              <li>Avoid jargon, acronyms, and unnecessarily complex language when simpler phrasing will do.</li>
              <li>Follow the &quot;Rule of 1/n&quot;: in a group of n people, speak roughly 1/nth of the time. Make one point, then let others speak.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-5 mb-2">Communication</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-muted-foreground space-y-2">
              <li>Assume the most generous interpretation of what someone says. If a comment seems off, ask for clarification before reacting.</li>
              <li>Listen actively. Don&apos;t interrupt. The more concise and relatable your point, the greater its impact.</li>
              <li>Whether on a panel or in informal conversation, avoid grandstanding and create space for others to participate.</li>
            </ul>

              <li>Keep discussions organized by posting in their appropriate channels or threads.</li>
              <li>Never share API keys, secret keys, or other sensitive credentials.</li>
              <li>Do not post unsolicited referral links, invitations to other communities, or promotional content unless specifically requested.</li>
              <li>Do not impersonate organizers, moderators, or other community members.</li>
              <li>Buy tickets only through the event’s official ticket page. Report unsolicited payment requests to the event organizers.</li>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-5 mb-2">Reporting</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              If you experience or witness a violation of this Code of Conduct:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-muted-foreground space-y-2 mt-2">
              <li><strong className="text-foreground">At the event:</strong> Find an event organizer member (identifiable by a blue wristband) or go to the information desk.</li>

            </ul>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-3">
              All reports will be reviewed and investigated. The event organizer is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the identity of the reporter.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
              unconference uses a straightforward two-step enforcement model:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-muted-foreground space-y-3">
              <li>
                <strong className="text-foreground">Warning</strong> — A private, direct communication to the individual explaining the nature of the violation and why the behavior is unacceptable. The individual will be given an opportunity to correct course.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-foreground">Removal</strong> — If the behavior continues after a warning — or if the initial violation is severe enough to warrant immediate action — the individual may be removed from the event and/or banned from online community spaces. This may include:
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                  <li>Expulsion from the in-person event with no refund</li>
                  <li>Removal from chat groups and other community channels</li>
                  <li>A ban from future unconference events and activities</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-3">
              The duration and conditions of any ban will be determined by the severity of the violation. The event organizer reserves the right to skip the warning step for serious violations (e.g., threats, harassment, or behavior that endangers others).
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-5 mb-2">Appeal</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Individuals subject to enforcement actions may appeal by submitting additional context or evidence in writing to{' '}
              <a href="mailto:conduct@schellingpoint.xyz" className="text-primary underline underline-offset-2">conduct@schellingpoint.xyz</a>{' '}
              within 14 days of the action. Appeals will be reviewed by a member of the organizing team who was not involved in the original decision.
